# Avoiding GraphQL N+1 problems by using preloading

Behind the scenes at zenshop is a very powerful [GraphQL api](https://graphql.pro) using ```graphql-ruby``` (which if you didn't know - is seriously amazing).

zenshop has alot of data, ```Customers, Orders, Conversations, Messages, Events...```, really the list goes on. You can imagine there's plenty of opportunity for N+1 problems.
