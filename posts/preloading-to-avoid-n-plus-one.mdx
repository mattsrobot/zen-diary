Behind the scenes at zenshop is a very powerful [GraphQL API](https://graphql.pro) using ```graphql-ruby``` - which if you didn't know - is **seriously amazing**.

zenshop has lots of data, ```Customers, Orders, Conversations, Messages, Events...```.

Really the list goes on, so you can imagine there's plenty of opportunity for N+1 problems.

There's essentially three main screens in zenshop I wanted to optimise to be faster:

- Conversations
- Customers
- Orders

Each screen had unique challenges for me due to the way the data was structured.

## Recap, what's an N+1 problem?

So what the heck is an N+1 problem anyway?

It was new to me too, so don't feel bad if you didn't know.

Lets say you fetch a bunch of orders, which belong to a customer, and you want to print out the name of the customer for each order you have.

```ruby
orders = Order.all

orders.each do |order|
  puts "Fetched order #{order.name} by #{order.customer.name}"
end
```

Simple right?

Actually, this is an N+1 problem.

You fetched the orders efficiently, but each time you print out that customer name, you're introducing the N+1 problem.

You can see it more clearly when you try this in the Rails console, but first, enable this magic:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
```

This will show you the database loads when something is happening.

What you'll notice is every time that loop happens, a customer load is called. This happens N+1 times, hence the name, N+1 problem!

In Rails the solution for this is to preload the customer association:

```ruby
orders = Order.preload(:customer).all
```

Ok great, if the solution is to preload everything, is there much more to talk about?

*A little...more...complex*

## Optimising conversations

So here's our beautiful zenshop...

*zenshop conversations*
<a href="/images/preloading-to-avoid-n-plus-one/conversations.png">
  <Image src="/images/preloading-to-avoid-n-plus-one/conversations.png" width={540} height={360} alt="zenshop conversations" />
</a>

Conversations are threads of ```Event``` in zenshop, this makes use of the ```delegated_type``` feature in Rails to enable a polymorphism for the association.

Events can be either a ```Message```, ```Note``` or ```Activity```. When a user loads up a conversation in zenshop, we must also fetch the events within the conversation, and this was previously quite slow due to the N+1 problem.

The conversation screen was actually the most challenging one for me to find solutions for, because ```delegated_type``` is a newer feature of Rails, but actually of course, like most things in Rails, the solution is beautifully simple.

*Fetching a single conversation (the conversation timeline)*

```ruby
conversation = Conversation
                .where(id: id, org: org)
                .preload({ events: { eventable: %i[org sender] } },
                         { mentioned_orders: { orderable: [:org] } },
                         { customer: [:org, { fields: :org, latest_order: { orderable: :org } }] })
                .first
```
*Fetching many conversations (the conversation list)*

```ruby
conversation = Conversation
                .preload({ mentioned_orders: { orderable: [:org] } })
                .includes({ customer: [:org, { fields: :org }] })
                .where(org: org, customer: { id: customer_id })
                .limit(100)
```

So conversations in zenshop are a little more complex than our earlier example, as you can see my query is a bit different.

There's ```preload```, but there's also ```includes```, why is that?

```includes``` does a similar thing to ```preload```, it's going to solve that N+1 problem for you, but it'll also allow you to query the data with the table you're including (in zenshops case, I could add something like:

```ruby
.where(customer: { id: 1 })
```

However, if I did this for polymorphic types you'll get the following error:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::EagerLoadPolymorphicError
```

If you get an ```ActiveRecord::EagerLoadPolymorphicError```, it's because includes decided to call ```eager_load``` when polymorphic associations are only supported by preload.

It's in the documentation [here](http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.1/classes/ActiveRecord/EagerLoadPolymorphicError.html)

So always use preload for polymorphic associations.

There is one caveat for this: you cannot query the polymorphic assocition in where clauses (which makes sense, since the polymorphic association represents multiple tables.)

## Handling nested polymorphic associations

The conversation timeline, as mentioned, has many events in the timeline.

Any event could be a message, and each message have a sender. Senders can be either a customer or a user.

So you see, the timeline has more going on here. How can I preload all this data?

```ruby
.preload({ events: { eventable: %i[org sender] } }
```

This line does the trick, it will load the sender, and it handles for situations when the sender doesn't exist on the table.

What does the SQL look like?

*My N+1 test for the query, just trying to preload events, messages and senders*

```ruby
conversation = Conversation.preload({ events: { eventable: %i[org sender] } }).find(1)

conversation.events.map(&:eventable).map { |s| s.respond_to?(:sender) ? s.sender : s.id }
```

```bash
Conversation Load (9.8ms)  SELECT `conversations`.* FROM `conversations` WHERE `conversations`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1
Event Load (0.6ms)  SELECT `events`.* FROM `events` WHERE `events`.`conversation_id` = 1
Activity Load (0.6ms)  SELECT `activities`.* FROM `activities` WHERE `activities`.`id` IN (1, 5, 6, 23, 24)
Message Load (0.8ms)  SELECT `messages`.* FROM `messages` WHERE `messages`.`id` IN (1, 2, 4, 13, 14, 15, 16)
Org Load (1.1ms)  SELECT `orgs`.* FROM `orgs` WHERE `orgs`.`id` = 1
Org Load (0.7ms)  SELECT `orgs`.* FROM `orgs` WHERE `orgs`.`id` = 1
Customer Load (0.6ms)  SELECT `customers`.* FROM `customers` WHERE `customers`.`id` = 1
User Load (2.4ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 1

 =>
[1,
 #<Customer:0x000000010cba7590>,
 nil,
 nil,
 5,
 6,
 nil,
 nil,
 nil,
 nil,
 23,
 24]
```

vs (bad query), just preloading the events.

```ruby
conversation = Conversation.preload({ events:  :eventable  }).find(1)

conversation.events.map(&:eventable).map { |s| s.respond_to?(:sender) ? s.sender : s.id }
```

```bash
Conversation Load (1.9ms)  SELECT `conversations`.* FROM `conversations` WHERE `conversations`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1
Event Load (4.9ms)  SELECT `events`.* FROM `events` WHERE `events`.`conversation_id` = 1
Activity Load (0.5ms)  SELECT `activities`.* FROM `activities` WHERE `activities`.`id` IN (1, 5, 6, 23, 24)
Message Load (0.4ms)  SELECT `messages`.* FROM `messages` WHERE `messages`.`id` IN (1, 2, 4, 13, 14, 15, 16)

Customer Load (0.8ms)  SELECT `customers`.* FROM `customers` WHERE `customers`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1
User Load (0.3ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1
User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1
User Load (0.3ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1
User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1
User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1
User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1

 =>
[1,
 #<Customer:0x000000010cba7590>,
 nil,
 nil,
 5,
 6,
 nil,
 nil,
 nil,
 nil,
 23,
 24]

```
You can see the addtional loads really slow down the query, especially if you have a longer time line.

## Optimising customers

So the next screen, customers.

Also difficult because customers have an field, ```latest_order``` in the GraphQL API.

Customers can have many orders, but we're interested in showing their latest one.

In this table, we want to quickly load all the customers, but also show their latest order, without N+1 problems.

*zenshop customers (in light mode!)*
<a href="/images/preloading-to-avoid-n-plus-one/customers.png">
  <Image src="/images/preloading-to-avoid-n-plus-one/customers.png" width={540} height={360} alt="zenshop customers" />
</a>

My previous attempt was simply to call ```orders.last``` to get the latest order, obviously this was causing N+1 problems.

The solution was to modify the models a bit:

```ruby
class Customer < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :orders
  has_one :latest_order, -> { latest_order_per_customers }, class_name: 'Order'
end

class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :customer, optional: true, counter_cache: true

  def self.latest_order_per_customers
    latest_orders_ids = select("max(id)").group(:customer_id)
    where(id: latest_orders_ids)
  end
end
```

Here were the modifications I made to the customer and order model, to quickly fetch the latest order I needed to create an association called ```latest_order``` which I could pass into the ```preload```.

## Optimising orders

Orders was probably the simplest one to do, I simply needed to preload the customer, nothing exciting here.

</a>

## Summary

In summary I'm really happy to start focusing more now on performance gains.

I have more plans, which I begin work on in August,

- Global deployment with Railway.app regions, so the web process is at the 'edge'.
- Using Planetscale database in multiple regions.
- Using a Redis cache in multiple regions with Upstash.
